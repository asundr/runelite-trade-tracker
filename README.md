# [Trade Tracker](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/trade-tracker)

### Overview

This RuneLite plugin tracks trades between other players, logging them for future reference in a searchable list.

Logged trades specify the name of the player traded, the time the trade was accepted, and all items given and received.

Additionally, these trade records use the GE prices of the items traded to calculate aggregate values of a trade.

Simple exchanges of coins for a single type of item are summarized to display how much was paid per item.
